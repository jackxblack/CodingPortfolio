Those are files from a personal project that I initially started creating in Unity3D. While the functionality that I aimed to create here (navigation system for game characters on a grid-based game field) works correctly, there are many errors here that I corrected in the Unreal Engine 4 version of the prototype. However, since that prototype is created in Blueprints visual scripting, it's not possible to provide raw files to showcase the difference.
